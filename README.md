"# IRE" 

This is a Python script to scrape data from the 2016 IRE Conference site.

It creates three files:

* List of panels, training workshops and other events at IRE 2016 in New Orleans
* List of speakers for the conference
* List of speakers with each event they are speaking at. (Many speakers on this list will be listed multiple times - one for every event they are speaking at).
