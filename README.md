"# IRE" 

This is a Python script to scrape data from the 2016 IRE Conference site.

It creates three pipe delimted files:

* List of panels, training workshops and other events at IRE 2016 in New Orleans
    IRE2016_events.txt
* List of speakers for the conference
    IRE2016_speakers.txt
* List of speakers with each event they are speaking at. (Many speakers on this list will be listed multiple times - one for every event they are speaking at).
    IRE2016_speakers_nodupes.txt
